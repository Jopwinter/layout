<h2>Crowd Shouts, Throws Things At Counter-Strike Tournament</h2>

<a class="casino" href="http://promo2.c-rewards.com/rea/pop/en/zc/2/" target="_blank"><img src="http://newsdaily-reports.com/nl/casino/206/index_files/zc300.gif" alt="Online Casinos – Finally The Real Truth Exposed!"></a><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<div class="card-panelcrowd">
	<img class="crowd2" src="./images/crowd.png"><p>Today, Virtus.pro swept a two game series against Cloud9 to win the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive finals at the DreamHack Open in Bucharest. The all-Polish team appeared all but unstoppable, defeating the Americans 16-9 on both the first map, Train, and the second, Cobblestone.</p>
	<p>However, during the finals, some people in the crowd began holding up signs to Virtus.pro reading “THEY ARE B” and “THEY ARE A,” potentially revealing important information about what Cloud 9 was or wasn’t up to.</p>
	<p>In this case, it was no doubt more of a troll than anything else, but some feel it threatens the integrity of the game either way. With $50,000 on the line, any distraction can cause havoc for the teams competing, and it’s up to venues and tournament organizers to prevent disruptions like the above.</p>
