<h2>Meet the anonymous watchdog who broke the CS:GO betting scandal</h2>

	<img class="bettingimg2" src="./images/betting.jpg"><p>One of 2016’s most explosive pieces of gaming journalism was broken by a news-obsessed Indian IT guy with a relatively unknown YouTube channel. HonorTheCall, an anonymous internet presence, is a full-time software developer whose YouTube image, up until June, was built on small-fry Call of Duty news. Over Call of Duty footage, HonorTheCall pronounced updates and opportunities exclusive to the COD community, facelessly and with a strong accent.</p>
	<p>In June, HonorTheCall’s video on shady Counter-Strike: Global Offensive gambling practices blew the lid off of a betting scandal implicating several top YouTube personalities. Upending a $2.3 billion dollar underground gambling industry around online video game skins, the amateur watchdog unearthed evidence that a CS:GO gambling site’s biggest promoters did not disclose their ownership of that same site. His report came out of nowhere. Ever since, Forbes, The Daily Dot, PC Gamer and IBTimes have pursued the leads HonorTheCall published on his Call of Duty YouTube channel.</p>
	<p>Now, he’s turned his humble channel into a full-blown accountability project for the YouTube gaming community and its adoring, though credulous fans. Just last week, he went digging again, and saw his channel briefly wiped from the Internet for his efforts.</p>
	<p>“I want to help fellow YouTubers,” HonorTheCall explained to me over the phone. “If there’s any under-the-table stuff going on, I want to warn them of potential scams or misleading information.”</p>
	<p>Alongside YouTube’s inflated personalities and the cults bolstering their empires is a growing industry of novice YouTube journalists. Like reporters, but ignorant or irreverent of the reporting method, these YouTubers post regular news videos about YouTube gaming celebrities. If you’re Scarce or Keemstar, these videos can attract millions of views. If not, the bigger fish are probably aggregating you. Anything from insipid “She said what?” gossip to unearthed online pyramid schemes fuels the movement that, many say, is the fungal stratosphere of YouTube metacommentary.</p>
	<p>“Drama” is big business for YouTubers. But HonorTheCall wants to be on the other end of the invisible, and frankly cosmetic scale of YouTube newsworthiness; more of a spectrum than a scale. Essentially, a YouTuber’s place on it is all a matter of packaging: Nearly nobody calls sources for comment. Everyone yells curse words into the microphone. Unabashed value judgments, comparisons to Ebola and accusations of autism are common. Also, a lot of trust is placed on superficial Googling, balanced by limited fact-checking. What makes HonorTheCall’s videos reminiscent of what many call “traditional journalism” is his professed obsession with public interest over views or money, even though his methods don’t deviate much from other YouTube reporters’.</p>
	<p>“I don’t hate anyone,” HonorTheCall told me. “I don’t have personal grudges. The thing that ticks me off is these guys have a huge responsibility running these channels, and sometimes, they shamelessly rip off their viewers—either by lying to them or selling them something that isn’t there, false hope, promise.”</p>
